# Toxic-Comment-Classification
In this competition,you are challenged to build a multi-label classification model for detecting different types of toxic comments like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate. You are provided with a large number of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior. You must create a model which predicts a probability of each type of toxicity for each comment.
